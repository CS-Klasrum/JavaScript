# Learn JavaScript by Examples

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that is based to the [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/) specification.

JavaScript is also one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScripts are downloaded and executed by the Client (Browser). JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.

A multi-paradigm programming language? JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

## Where to run?

Here are the options for running the JavaScript codes:

1. Web Browser Console (Google Chrome, FireFox, Microsoft Edge, etc...)
2. Inside HTML using `script` tag.

```html
<script>
console.log("Hello CMIan!");
</script>
```

3. Using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```sh
node ./2\ -\ Console.js
```
